# C++ Language

#### Python-Programs in .py files
Learning python by practicing programs in spyder

Soon DS questions will be added to practice.

# 100DaysOfCode 
This will be the repository for C++ topic wise questions, practice questions and DSA :)

Day 19:
Hackerrank problems

Day 20:
Vectors and linked list

Day 21:
Hackerearth coding contest challenge

Day 22:
Earned 5 star on hackerrank C++ badge

Day 23:
Hackerrank contest and problem solving

Day 24:
Vectors Practice with leetcode questions

Day 25:
Leetcode questions( used vectors bool and stack and started using in functions)

Day 26:
Leetcode questions (string and functions)
Total 7 done

Day 27:
Leetcode questions (9 done)(Remove dupliates using unique)  Done 12 questions :)

Day 28:
Leetcode climbing question, single number(Using XOR ques) learnt new approach [Done 15 questions]
