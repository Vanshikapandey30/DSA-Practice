Day 19:
Hackerrank problems

Day 20:
Vectors and linked list

Day 21:
Hackerearth coding contest challenge

Day 22:

Day 24:
Vectors Practice with leetcode questions

Day 25:
Leetcode questions( used vectors bool and stack and started using in functions)

Day 26:
Leetcode questions (string and functions)
Total 7 done

Day 27:
Leetcode questions (9 done)(Remove dupliates using unique)  Done 12 questions :)

Day 28:
Leetcode climbing question, sinlge number(Using XOR ques) learnt new approach [Done 15 questions]

Day 29:
Leetcode 17 questions done. Finally (Done 22) completed 1.32% :)

Day 30:
Leetcode 23 questions done ((((break time))))

Day 31:
Stacks and Linked list understanding using stl (using stl reduces the lines of code and makes it easy to understand the code)
