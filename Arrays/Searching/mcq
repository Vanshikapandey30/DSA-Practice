Which of the following is correct recurrence for worst case of Binary Search?
A
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
B
T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
C
T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)
D
T(n) = T(n-2) + O(1) and T(1) = T(0) = O(1)

Answer - C


Question 2 Explanation: 
Following is typical implementation of Binary Search. In Binary Search, we first compare the given element x with middle of the array. 
If x matches with middle element, then we return middle index. 
Otherwise, we either recur for left half of array or right half of array. So recurrence is T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)
