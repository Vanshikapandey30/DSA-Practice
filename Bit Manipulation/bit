BIT- 
  * Binary numbers
  * Additions and Subtraction(actually there is no such thing as subtraction in computer) We Use 1's and 2's Compliment to find the addition and subtraction.
  * Bitwise operators [ &(and), |(or), ^(xor), ~(inverse), >>(right shift or divide by 2), <<(left shift or multiply by 2)]
  
  Example questions where to use bit
  ** Odd Even numbers [if(x%2==0)] we can write it as [a & 1==0] then even, else odd]
  ** Swap two numbers 
    We use,  temp=a;
             a=b;
             b=temp;
           and thus we get the elements swapped by using third variable, but using BIT we can do this in more efficient way also we don't have to use the third 
           element to swap the numbers.
           
           a = a ^ b;
           b = a ^ b;
           a = a ^ b;
           
           now elements will be swapped without using extra variable.
