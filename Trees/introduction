Binary Tree Data Structure

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. 
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

A Binary Tree node contains following parts.

   * Data
   * Pointer to left child
   * Pointer to right child

  (a) Inorder (Left, Root, Right) : 4 2 5 1 3
  (b) Preorder (Root, Left, Right) : 1 2 4 5 3
  (c) Postorder (Left, Right, Root) : 4 5 2 3 1
